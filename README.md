# Machine Learning from Scratch - Python 3

## Overview 
In this package, we've implemented a few basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3.6. The algorithms are as follows:
    
    - Perceptron Algorithm (TP1)
    - Pocket Perceptron (TP1)
    - Adaline Algorithm with delta rule (TP)
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Polynomial Regression 
    - One-vs-All and One-vs-One Classifiers

Furthermore, we've implemented a few basic algorithms useful in the cristalization of learning theory :

    - Non-Linear Transformation
    - Cross Validation with K-Fold
    - Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression
    - Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression
    - Bias and Variance <i>(not implemented yet)</i>
    - Vapnik Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-Dimension)
    - Covering and Uniform Covering Number

These codes were made in the context of the Learning Theory course Fall 2023 at ENSIAS - University Mohammed V - Rabat, Morocco.

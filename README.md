## Overview 
In this package, we've implemented a few basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3.8. The algorithms are as follows:
    
- Single Layer Perceptron Algorithm 
- Pocket Perceptron
- Adaline Algorithm with delta rule 
- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression 
- Polynomial Regression
- One-vs-All and One-vs-One Classifiers

Furthermore, we've implemented a few basic algorithms useful in the cristalization of learning theory :

- Non-Linear Transformation
- Cross Validation with K-Fold 
- Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression 
- Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression
- Bias and Variance <i>(not implemented yet)</i>
- Vapnik Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-Dimension) 
- Covering and Uniform Covering Number

Finally, we also added a few basic functions to help you create dummy data and plot results of the algorithms :

- Generate Dummy Data (in 2D and 3D)
- Plot Linear Decision Boundary (in 2D and 2D)
- Plot Non-Linear Decision Boundary (in 2D)

All the algorithms and tools are implemented in the `lib` folder.

These codes were made in the context of the Learning Theory course Fall 2023 at ENSIAS - University Mohammed V - Rabat, Morocco. You can find the LABS and the corresponding PDFs in the `ensias_labs` folder.

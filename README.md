## Overview 
In this package, we've implemented a few basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3.6. The algorithms are as follows:
    
- Single Layer Perceptron Algorithm (LAB1)
- Pocket Perceptron (LAB1)
- Adaline Algorithm with delta rule (LAB1)
- Linear Regression (LAB2)
- Logistic Regression (LAB2)
- Polynomial Regression (LAB3 and LAB4)
- One-vs-All and One-vs-One Classifiers (LAB5)

Furthermore, we've implemented a few basic algorithms useful in the cristalization of learning theory :

- Non-Linear Transformation (LAB4)
- Cross Validation with K-Fold (LAB6)
- Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression (ALL LABS EXCEPT LAB1)
- Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression (LAB7)
- Bias and Variance <i>(not implemented yet)</i> (LAB5)
- Vapnik Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-Dimension) (bounds)
- Covering and Uniform Covering Number (bounds)

These codes were made in the context of the Learning Theory course Fall 2023 at ENSIAS - University Mohammed V - Rabat, Morocco.

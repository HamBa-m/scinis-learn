## Overview 
In this package, we've implemented a few basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3.6. The algorithms are as follows:
    
- Perceptron Algorithm (TP1)
- Pocket Perceptron (TP1)
- Adaline Algorithm with delta rule (TP)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression 
- One-vs-All and One-vs-One Classifiers

Furthermore, we've implemented a few basic algorithms useful in the cristalization of learning theory :

- Non-Linear Transformation
- Cross Validation with K-Fold
- Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression
- Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression
- Bias and Variance <i>(not implemented yet)</i>
- Vapnik Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-Dimension)
- Covering and Uniform Covering Number

These codes were made in the context of the Learning Theory course Fall 2023 at ENSIAS - University Mohammed V - Rabat, Morocco.
